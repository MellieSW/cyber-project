# TryHackMe Lab Notes – Carmel Delcy

These are my personal notes and writeups from the TryHackMe labs I’ve completed.

---

## Room: Intro to Cyber Security
- **Topics covered:** Networking basics, attack types, CIA Triad
- **Key takeaway:** I learned how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model applies to security.

## Room: Linux Fundamentals
- Practiced basic Linux navigation, file permissions, and users
- Commands like `ls`, `chmod`, `sudo`, and `grep` are now part of my toolkit

## Room: Nmap
- **Scanned my first target machine**
- Learned about TCP SYN scans and port ranges
- Favorite command:  
  ```bash
  nmap -sS -p 1-1000 -v targetIP
